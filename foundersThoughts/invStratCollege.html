        <p>
            According to Forbes, 87% of teens say they don't really understand their personal finances (2022). The need for financial literacy programs is undeniable. As of January 2024,
            twenty-five U.S. states require financial education for high school students to graduate; many more have bills pending.
        </p> 

        <p class="font-bold my-5">Prepare students for their financial future</p>
        
        <p>
            Financial education is more than dollars and cents. It’s about establishing better spending habits, instilling confidence, and equipping the next generation with the real-world
            skills to manage financial goals and milestones.
        </p> 
        
        
        <p class="font-bold my-5">How are we doing this?</p>
        <p>
            FAI raised initial funding from friends and family to jumpstart the initiative. We have also worked with a financial institution to grant some money towards purchasing teaching tools
            that help in the process of educating teens on Financial concepts. We have also spearheaded chapter enrollment initiative to recruit interested students from various school districts
            worldwide to create FAI school chapters in respective institutions. Together with the resources we created and the leadership team at FAI, we have successfully enabled FAI school chapters
            to teach / mentor members in their local chapters.
